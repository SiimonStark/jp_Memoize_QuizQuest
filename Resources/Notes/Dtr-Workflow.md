1: Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
  Justin: 
    - This project could have actual usability, at least to our team. 
    - So I'm really excited to get working on this. I would like to be able to get this project to a rather polished state.
    - I'm interested in learning React to get this app up off the ground. While keeping things modular and dynamic!
  Jake: 
    - 
  Devin: 
    - 

2: What do we want to achieve as a team? 
  - We plan on creating an app that will save the user brain power/energy in making the most difficult question a gamer could possibly face! Having to pick which game to play next!

3: How will we know that we're successful?):
  - Our definition of succes is: 
    giving the user an app that is convenient, quick, and intuitive to use. 
  - I deal scenario:
    being able to whip your phone out of your pocket, to quickly pick a game to play, and being able to easily filter your search.

4: Team strengths & collaboration styles:
  Justin:
    - SwissArmy Knife, resourceful.
    - Little bit of everything.
    - I'm flexible and ready to learn new stuff.
  Jake:
    - 
  Devin:
    - 

5: How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
  - As a team I know we can tackle this project head on and power through the primary functionality of our app.
  - We will be able to dive deep into obstacles that arise. 
    - Rather than avoid them, we will get to the root cause and either adapt or strategize a new plan of action.


6: Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
  - Weekdays:
    - we are willing to do what it takes to make sure that we are hitting all of our milestones.
  - Weekend:
    -  Will certainly be a challenge, due to team members' obligations.
      - We have scheduled late night calls to combat the time constraints.

7: Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
  - We will primarily use Slack or Discord as our primary means of communication, which will be available throughtout the evenings.
  - We plan to keep track of one another's progress on Waffle.io.
  - Each day we will send a quick update
    - What we accomplished that day,
    - What we plan to do the following day, 
    - and what we struggled with

8: Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  Justin:
    - I would really like to get a better handle on OOP
    - While finding a groove with React
  Jake: 
    - 
  Devin:
    - 

9: Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
  - We will be doing a lot of work in unison, whether that be at school or remotely
  - The idea is to review all major PRs and functionality before merging to master
  - When we face an issue we will discuss as a group, otherwise reach out to our peers in the comminity, at school and mentors.

11: Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  - We will be KIND and helpful
  - While also making sure that once the issue is resolved that all parties understand what, why, and how to overcome to the obstacle.

12: Project management tools we will use:
  - Waffle.io
  - Slack

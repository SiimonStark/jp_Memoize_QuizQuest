General Mission:
  - We want to create a Game Picker designed by gamers for gamers
    - Our long term mission is to make the app dynamic enough that we can expand to any number of users.
  - We want to create an app that is seamless and easy for a new user to pickup and understand.
    - Frustration will take away precious time from the user.
    - We know that the user will in most cases be using their phone to navigate our app. Seeing as when they are getting ready to decide on a game, their phone will be the most accesible online tool.

Phase One: Landing page
  - We like to think that less is more.
    - The user already can't decide on what game to play, and doesn't want to fumble through too many choices while using our app.
  - The landing page will be a simple search engine with filters.
  - Along with a field to display the results at a glance.
    - Where you can then click on the game title to be taken to a screen with more information on the game.
  - For super speedy decision making
    - Feeling Lucky Button, to randomize game

Phase Two: More Info
  - There should be a way for the user to get more information/tools.
    - Adding a hamburger-menu/ navigation that is out of the way, but still accessible.
      - All genres available and description.
      -Profile Section.

Phase Three: Local User
  - Profile section, where users can add games from our dataset to their own library.
    - To keep track of the games they own.
    - To have record of how many times they've played each game.
    - Remember most recent played game

Phase Four: Interactive (Extension)
  - Earn Badges:
    - Based on number of plays.
    - Trying something new.
    - Playing a game they haven't played in awhile.
